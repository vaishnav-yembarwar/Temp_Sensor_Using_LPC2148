# Temp_Sensor_Using_LPC2148
This project is a voltage monitoring system using the LPC2148 microcontroller. It reads analog voltage using the ADC and displays the value on a 16x2 LCD. A buzzer is activated through a transistor if the voltage goes beyond set limits. The system uses an LM35 sensor for analog input.
